# Project Goals and Background

In the 21st century, huge amounts of data are generated, especially in technology-driven sectors like retail. Walmart, a major retail player, relies on data to predict future sales and compete globally. With over 11,000 stores worldwide, understanding customer behavior is vital. This research aims to forecast Walmart's sales based on historical data, considering factors like temperature and holidays. By analyzing past data and using big data analytics, Walmart can optimize sales, promotions, and resources, ensuring competitiveness and profitability in the dynamic market.

# Purpose Statement:
This study aims to predict how much Walmart will sell each week based on data collected from 45 different stores across the country, spanning from 2010 to 2013. The dataset includes information about store size, type, departments, weekly sales, and whether it's a holiday week. We're looking at various factors like Consumer Price Index, temperature, fuel prices, promotions, and unemployment rates to figure out if they influence weekly sales. It helps understand the patterns and connections between sales and these factors.
This study also includes an extensive exploratory data analysis on the provided Walmart dataset to understand the following:
• Identifying store as well as department-wide sales in Walmart
• Identifying sales based on store size and type
• Identifying how much sales increase during holidays
• Correlation between the different factors that affect sales
• Average sales per year
• Weekly sales as per region temperature, CPI, fuel price, unemployment
Project Description:

Title: Walmart Store Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data from Walmart stores and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The analysis aims to identify patterns in sales data and group stores or customers based on similar characteristics. This segmentation can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, inventory management, and overall business optimization.

Project Steps:

1. **Data Gathering:**
   - The project starts with the collection of data from Walmart stores. The dataset includes information such as store details, weekly sales, holiday flags, temperature, fuel prices, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and unemployment rates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
   - Check for missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics.
   - Perform feature engineering if needed, such as dropping unnecessary columns.

3. **Outlier Detection and Handling:**
   - Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to ensure that they do not negatively impact the clustering results.
   - Utilize statistical methods to detect and replace outliers.

4. **Data Scaling:**
   - Standardize the numerical features using Standard Scaler to bring them to a common scale.
   - This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

5. **2D Clustering:**
   - Explore 2D clustering using different pairs of features, such as Temperature vs. Fuel Price, Holiday_Flag vs. Fuel_Price, and Temperature vs. CPI.
   - Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to group data points.

6. **3D Clustering:**
   - Extend the analysis to 3D clustering by selecting three relevant features.
   - Visualize the clusters in a 3D scatter plot for better understanding.

7. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Perform customer segmentation using features like Weekly_Sales, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, etc.
   - Apply KMeans clustering to group customers based on similar purchasing behavior.

8. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of clustering using metrics such as Inertia and Silhouette Score.
   - These metrics provide insights into the compactness of clusters and the separation between them.

9. **Visualization:**
   - Utilize visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create informative plots and charts.
   - Present the clusters and patterns discovered in a visually appealing manner.

10. **Project Documentation:**
    - Document the entire project, including the dataset used, methodologies applied, and key findings.
    - Provide explanations for the choices made during data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

11. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
    - Summarize the key insights obtained from the analysis.
    - Provide recommendations for Walmart based on the identified clusters, such as targeted marketing strategies, store-specific initiatives, and inventory management improvements.
