This study aims to predict how much Walmart will sell each week based on data collected from 45 different stores across the country, spanning from 2010 to 2013. The dataset includes information about store size, type, departments, weekly sales, and whether it's a holiday week. We're looking at various factors like Consumer Price Index, temperature, fuel prices, promotions, and unemployment rates to figure out if they influence weekly sales. It helps understand the patterns and connections between sales and these factors.
This study also includes an extensive exploratory data analysis on the provided Walmart dataset to understand the following:
#### • Identifying store as well as department-wide sales in Walmart
#### • Identifying sales based on store size and type
#### • Identifying how much sales increase during holidays
#### • Correlation between the different factors that affect sales
#### • Average sales per year
#### • Weekly sales as per region temperature, CPI, fuel price, unemployment
